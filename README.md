# LangChain Runnables

LangChainâ€™s **Runnables** are modular building blocks for AI pipelines, allowing tasks to be composed in flexible ways. **RunnableSequence** runs steps in order, **RunnableLambda** wraps Python functions for custom logic, **RunnableParallel** executes tasks concurrently, **RunnablePassthrough** preserves input unchanged, and **RunnableBranch** routes data conditionally. Together, they enable clean, composable, and maintainable workflows for LLMs and data processing, making it easy to build efficient and adaptable pipelines.

## Features

- **Sequence:** Chain multiple tasks step-by-step.
- **Lambda:** Wrap Python functions as runnables.
- **Parallel:** Run tasks concurrently and merge results.
- **Passthrough:** Preserve original inputs across pipelines.
- **Branch:** Conditional routing based on input or logic.
